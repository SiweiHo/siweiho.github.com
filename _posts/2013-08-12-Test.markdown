This is the first blog that I published in this space.

Actually, I have another blog on Netease, which has run since  2010. In that blog, 
I share my experience on research, life, and also reprint some article that I think 
good.

I write this blog mainly for learning the new script, that is 
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

**First, let me try how to insert a picture on blog.**

![This is a MATLAB plot from MIT open course](/images/pic01.jpg)

*A MATLAB plot of the Basin of Attraction for a function. (Image by Yossi Farjoun.)*

**Second, I want to try the function of highlighting source codes **. For example, the 
followings are some MATLAB codes

This failed!!

OK, this is the end!
