**GNUPLOT**

With no doubt, MATLAB is one of the most powerful software for calculation
and plot. However, it is not free. So I have to find something to replace
it. GNUPLOT is the one that I used to plot. It is powerful and also the figure
is beautiful. More information you can visit its offical website. 

**GRASS GIS**

This is the one that I used to replace ArcGis. I have to admit that ArcGis
is powerful and user-friendly. The biggest problem is also relate with money.
I think GRASS can do as good as ArcGis except for map plotting. Another 
advantage of GRASS is freedom, I think. It can export data into many 
different format. Combining with Python, GRASS is a good choice for batch
processing.

**LATEX**

Latex is the traditional words processing program. It is a better choice
for alternative of OFFICE.

**VIM**
It is said that VIM is the most powerful editor in the world. I think this
maybe true. I am a newcomer for VIM.
